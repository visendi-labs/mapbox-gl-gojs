## NB
- You'll need a Mapbox API key to display the map when running locally: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/guides/.

## HTMX
HTMX can be used to together with Mapbox-GL-GOJS to tie interactivity content/config changes from the server. Mapbox-GL-GOJS even comes with some built-in HTMX support, so that you can (serverside) generate a map setup that ties map events to HTMX calls (that will make further request to your server).
